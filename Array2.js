const meal= ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner'];
let [starter] = meal
console.log(starter) 
// Here we can see that the first element of the array is assigned to the variable starter.
// Now we will see how to assign the first and second element of the array to the variables starter and main:
// For example:
const meal2= ['breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner'];
let [starter2, main] = meal2
console.log(starter2, main)
// Here we can see that the first and second element of the array is assigned to the variables starter2 and main.
// The for of loop works for object data types: true or false: false
