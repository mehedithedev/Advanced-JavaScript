// In this problem you have to reverse a string
// The first step is to create a function that takes a string as a parameter
// The second step is to split the string into an array
// The third step is to reverse the array
// The fourth step is to join the array
// The fifth step is to return the reversed string
// At last we have to call the function and pass a string as a parameter

let str= 'This one is a string'
const strReverse= (str)=>{
    return str.split()
}
strReverse(str)
